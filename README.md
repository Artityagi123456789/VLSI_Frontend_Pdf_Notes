Counter:
👉 4-bit Synchronous Up counter:
 ● A four-bit synchronous up counter is a digital circuit that counts in binary from 0000 to 1111 (0 to 15) and increments by 1 for each clock pulse.
 ● The counter has four flip-flops, one for each bit of the count, and it counts up in a synchronous manner, meaning all the flip-flops change their states simultaneously on the rising edge or falling edge of the clock signal. 

👉 Up/Down Counter:
 ● An up/down counter is a digital electronic device that can count either up or down depending on the control signal. 
 ● It can increment or decrement its count based on the input signals it receives. 
 ● The control signal (commonly denoted as "upordown") determines the direction of the counting process.
 ● When it's set to '1', the counter counts up; when set to '0', the counter counts down.
